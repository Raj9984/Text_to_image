# Text_to_image
This project uses the Stable Diffusion model to generate images from textual descriptions. The repository is organized into four main sections: a Jupyter Notebook for running the model, a directory for generated images, a requirements file for setting up the environment, and a deployment file for serving the model via a web server.
